# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
This repository contains my codes and lab reports for my fifth-semester course of Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I'm very fond of programming and am always looking to create new and better algorithms for various tasks and problems as well as being amazed by different ways to solve a problem and optimize solutions. Some codes here in my repo might be similar to codes found online mostly from geeks for geeks and educative because I use this website to learn and practice. However these are ones I have practised a lot and came to understanding of how they work, their time and space complexities , code optimization and various applications.
